# Parsing FIT files because fuck APIs

Ok that's a bit dramatic. It just looks like using the raw fit data from the watch is gonna be better for getting super granular data for sonification.

This uses the fit-parse python library. 

## TODO

- Pull the data to visualize it
- Create parallels (one raw, one quantized, one smoothed)
- Timeline it (?!? how tho)
- Package it to be fed into Ableton
- labelling. Lots of labelling
