# Parsing FIT files because fuck APIs

Ok that's a bit dramatic. It just looks like using the raw fit data from the watch is gonna be better for getting super granular data for sonification.

This uses the fit-parse python library. 

Also RTmidi seems to be the simple way to punch midi data out using abritrary values. Map values to midi ranges, turn some of them into LFOs etc.

## TODO

Big fucking todo is check if these todos still make sense

- Pull the data to visualize it
- Create parallels (one raw, one quantized, one smoothed)
- Timeline it (?!? how tho)
- Package it to be fed into Ableton
- labelling. Lots of labelling
