clav climber ableton project is kinda reverse engineered based on what data I've seen so far. 

Obviously there's more that can be done but even mapping root note to heart rate, 
and sending midi chords based on modulo 
(i.e odd numbers minor 9s, even major 9 as is in the project)
would make something that is sonically interesting through that clav patch.

On the other side, theres a filter randomly stepping alongside the output sound - instead of using the random LFO on the filter, use less predictable numbers to controll that directly

You can control the little offset on echo and delay with midi you know...


Note echo is literally midi delay tho
